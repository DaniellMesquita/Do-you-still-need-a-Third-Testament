<center><h1>4th song by Daniell Mesquita</h1></center>

<h3>Stronger than wine</h3>

<ol>
<li>How could God be, if he did not love exist?</li>
<li>Without love, nothing would exist.</li>
<li>And before God created us, God loves to exist.</li>
<li>Love is the reason for existence.</li>
<li>God is in us, feeling everything we feel.</li>
<li>And before we love him, he loved us, and still loves, and will always love.</li>
<li>And how does God feel, when we do not forgive who he loves?</li>
<li>We are all bodies of God, we embrace in this pain, until the new body of our Lord comes.</li>
<li>Ah, love is:</li>
<li>Drink stronger than wine; a song more beautiful than that of a bird;</li>
<li>One does not learn by reading a parchment; from the cradle you have the affection.</li>
<li>Love you eat, eat, eat and do not vomit.</li>
<li>Love eats, eats, eats, and grows lighter.</li>
<li>Love you drink, drink, drink and do not get dizzy.</li>
<li>Love you drink, drink, drink and become more and more lucid.</li>
<li>Jesus is the bread of life, and love is the bread of the soul.</li>
<li>Wine is the liquid of the body, and love is the liquid of the soul.</li>
<li>Love is not in physical attraction, love sees the inner; it is soul love.</li>
<li>God does not care about our differences, but with our soul; and let our love be in the soul.</li>
<li>In love there is no debauchery; in love there is sincere, joyful and innocent laughter.</li>
<li>Love celebrates and admires good things, and does not become blind.</li>
<li>Love is living feeling, and quickens everything.</li>
<li>Love is the meaning of life.</li>
<li>Oh, love is:</li>
<li>Drink stronger than wine; song more beautiful than a bird.</li>
<li>You can not learn by reading a parchment; from the cradle you have the affection.</li>
<li>Love you eat, eat, eat and do not vomit.</li>
<li>Love eats, eats, eats, and grows lighter.</li>
<li>Love you drink, drink, drink and do not get dizzy.</li>
<li>Love you drink, drink, drink and become more and more lucid.</li>
