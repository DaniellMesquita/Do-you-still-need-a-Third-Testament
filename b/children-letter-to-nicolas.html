<center><h1>Letter to Nicolas</h1></center>

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<ol>
<li>Letter addressed to this who have a great deal to know about God, for being less than 11 years old;</li>
<li>But who has superior and sufficient intellect so that he may read and understand great mysteries.</li>
<li>You remind me a lot when at your age;</li>
<li>Personality, thoughts, tastes, etc.</li>
<li>You answered your brother Leonardo when he said, "I am Jesus," and responded very well. Responded with authority.</li>
<li>And to God it does not matter if you are Mormons, if you follow in Spirit and in truth.</li>
<li>Because for God there is no difference between black and white, agnostic and spiritist, catholic and evangelical, testimonies of Jehovah and Mormons;</li>
<li>Everyone has the opportunity to follow the same truth, which is independent of religions.</li>
<li>And I relune the religions.</li>
<li>Once you said, "If this beast is not of God, why, if God created?"</li>
<li>All animals are of God;</li>
<li>But the serpent is a symbol of the devil, who used the form for temptations.</li>
<li>Then why did God create bad things?</li>
<li>Why did he create venomous animals that poison people?</li>
<li>Because here is not heaven, and the best things God holds as treasure. For us. And we will love it.</li>
<li>We know the bad things on earth, to admire even more the good things in heaven, when we can say:</li>
<li>"Look at this, on Earth it was not like that, it's worth what we live there".</li>
<li>But we can not want to die: our life, of us humans here, is sacred.</li>
<li>It is a test, in which an unforgivable sin commits one to give up;</li>
<li>But those who overcome will be crowned and crowned.</li>
<li>Live intensely, but be careful not to sin.</li>
<li>Then saidst thou:</li>
<li>"But everyone is a sinner, so everyone goes to hell?" But not all are sinners because they will;</li>
<li>For he sinneth against God, he that sinneth, knowing he is sinning.</li>
<li>But we are sinners by simply sinning.</li>
<li>But God says that we must seek to perfect ourselves, as Christ is perfect.</li>
<li>And we must seek to be holy, even if we are mocked for being different;</li>
<li>But do not feel bad if you can not, because Christ Jesus prefers those who are not afraid.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<ol>
<li>You are very agitated, and this agitation brings you hunger for learning, intelligence and creativity;</li>
<li>And one day you may use this to announce the gospel (the word of God) to all.</li>
<li>But it will not do any good (neither for you nor for those who are evangelized) if you do not have faith and especially love.</li>
<li>What does the gospel mean?</li>
<li>Is it a evangelical thing?</li>
<li>Thing of "crentes"? Not;</li>
<li>Because even Catholics, and Spiritists, and Mormons, and testimonies of Jehovah; these also evangelize.</li>
<li>Praying and "rezar" are the same (although each religion erects its labels), as missions and evangelizing are intertwined.</li>
<li>Gospel means: good news.</li>
<li>The gospel did not come from the gospel religion (evangelic), but the gospel religion comes from the gospel.</li>
<li>But evangelizing does not make you evangelical, but even more pleasing to God.</li>
<li>For the grace which God hath in the ..</li>
<li>Did you notice that the leaf has marks of earth? At that moment, the doggy of your bro jumped here.</li>
<li>For the grace that God sees in people is not religion; but love, wisdom and faith.</li>
<li>Even agnostics can have that, and that's all people need.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<ol>
<li>I am not good at fasting, and this is a grave fault coming from one who proclaims the mysteries of God;</li>
<li>I ask you to pray for me, so that the Holy Spirit may bless me in fasting with all the necessary gifts.</li>
<li>But yesterday I was in a greater fast, and I wrote mighty things;</li>
<li>So it is because I can no longer write in this letter without first asking you to ask me to heal all your doubts about God, Bible, existence, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<ol>
<li>I asked you if you would like to write your doubts, but you denied it by saying that you do not have them.</li>
<li>I do not believe this, but I am not a annoying from Jesus;</li>
<li>I do not know what to say, but I know why.</li>
<li>The devil reads before and wants to disrupt, and commands; but I will not be like him.</li>
<li>Follow your heart; the devil forces, but Christians are meek.</li>
<li>When yall have doubts or sadness, I ask you to reread.</li>
<li>If they invent things by this letter, and the other cause strife; I'm happy to just do what I have to.</li>
<li>I ask God to give you inner health and peace, and reread ..</li>
