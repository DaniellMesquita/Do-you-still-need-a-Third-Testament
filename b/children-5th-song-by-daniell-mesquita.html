<h2>My little ones of Jesus</h2>

<ol>
<li>My little ones of Jesus:</li>
<li>Hearken unto this little brother, and follow the way of God his Father.</li>
<li>God of David, is also the God of You.</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth is also the Jesus of Heaven.</li>
<li>God of Israel, also God of Brazil.</li>
<li>Jehovah is also called Existence.</li>
<li>The Spirit of Jesus rounds the earth, and is welcoming all the little ones on the hem of their garments.</li>
<li>With much love he caresses his little children, and comforts and comforts hearts.</li>
<li>Jesus is more beautiful than all flowers;</li>
<li>Jesus is sweeter than all honey;</li>
<li>Jesus is kinder than a lamb;</li>
<li>Jesus is more loving than your kitten.</li>
<li>My little ones of Jesus:</li>
<li>Hearken unto this little brother, and follow the way of God his Father.</li>
<li>God of David, is also the God of You.</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth is also the Jesus of Heaven.</li>
<li>God of Israel, is also the God of Brazil.</li>
<li>Jehovah is also called Existence.</li>
<li>There is a crystal clear river, and the sound of the waters calms.</li>
<li>There is a garden, the most beautiful, God guards as a treasure.</li>
<li>There is a heaven full of angels, and Jesus Christ reigns.</li>
<li>There is a people here who adore you, Lord, and expect to be adopted.</li>
<li>His children are his angels on earth;</li>
<li>Your song, we love it very much;</li>
<li>Your smiles, comfort and renew your whole soul;</li>
<li>And in the brightness of their eyes the adults can see many things.</li>
<li>My little ones of Jesus:</li>
<li>Hearken unto this little brother, and follow the way of God his Father.</li>
<li>God of David, is also the God of You.</li>
Jesus of Nazareth is also the Jesus of Heaven.</li>
<li>God of Israel, also God of Brazil.</li>
<li>Jehovah is also called Existence.</li>
<li>God knows everything about everything and everyone;</li>
<li>Before you were you, God knew you.</li>
<li>God knows what you feel and need;</li>
<li>But we still pray, for this is a pleasant sacrifice.</li>
<li>Jesus is kinder than your grandmother;</li>
<li>Jesus is more loving than your puppy;</li>
<li>Jesus is more beautiful than anything and everyone;</li>
<li>Jesus is sweeter than all chocolate.</li>
<li>My little ones of Jesus:</li>
<li>Hearken unto this little brother, and follow the way of God his Father.</li>
<li>God of David is also the God of You.</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth is also the Jesus of Heaven.</li>
<li>God of Israel, also God of Brazil.</li>
<li>​​Jehovah is also called Existence.</li>
<li>God chose dumb things to confound the wise;</li>
<li>God chose the weak things to confound the strong;</li>
<li>God made the poor richer than the millionaires;</li>
<li>God knows your little ones are big.</li>
<li>There is the Earth, where humans are small;</li>
<li>There is the Universe, where the Earth is so small;</li>
<li>There is Heaven, where the Universe is microscopic;</li>
<li>There is God, where Heaven has no size.</li>
<li>My little ones of Jesus: pay attention to this little brother and follow the way of God his Father.</li>
<li>God of David, is also the God of You.</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth is also the Jesus of Heaven.</li>
<li>God of Israel, he is also the God of Brazil.</li>
<li>Jehovah is also called Existence.</li>
<li>My little ones of God: pay attention to this little brother and follow the way of Jesus.</li>
