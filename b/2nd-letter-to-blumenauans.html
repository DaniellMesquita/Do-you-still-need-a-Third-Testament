<center><h1>2nd letter to Blumenauans</h1><img src="img/blumenauans/2.png"/></center>

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
<ol>
<li>You do not know when this was written, nor who writes, but know who wants to talk to you.</li>
<li>I do not know if you are a man or a woman.</li>
<li>But what does it matter? You are reading, and you can build with it.</li>
<li>I do not know your mistakes, your name, your surname, your schooling, your financial conditions;</li>
<li>However, I direct this letter to any resident of Blumenau and neighboring towns, who may receive light by reading this.</li>
<li>Daniell, a very flawed servant, I write this after contending and inclining to desires.</li>
<li>I saw a wind like never before in Blumenau, dragging leaves and making a loud sound.</li>
<li>I had thought of throwing this letter from a high place, but I was told that this is not necessary, and I have to write the letters without thinking of other things.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>I am perplexed about today's Christianity.</li>
<li>Only talk about prosperity, victory, achievements, a fabulous life gifted, superb, etc.</li>
<li>Teach people to be like the foolish;</li>
<li>Of whom the Bible briefly referred, as also predicted what is happening today, in 2 Timothy 4: 3:</li>
<li>"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but with their ears itching, they will heap doctors for themselves according to their own lusts."</li>
<li>Who are these doctors? Pastors who preach prosperity today.</li>
<li>And many churches do not want to admit losing believers to other churches</li>
<li>(competitors, as if it were a capital competition) and then they preach only what pleases man, and so they fill their churches.</li>
<li>But we can not speak pleasing man, but speaking what is fitting for building up people and souls to please God.</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 4:14: "I do not write these things to put you to shame, but I admonish you as my beloved children."</li>
<li>If I have a son that hinders him;</li>
<li>I will allow him to do this within my house so that while he, alive, does not come out of it,</li>
<li>Or with love will I rebuke him, lest he come out dead?</li>
<li>It is similar to that which happens in the churches today.</li>
<li>Do they prefer that the faithful keep their souls dying, or that they hear the truth even if they want to leave?</li>
<li>What's the use of having the church full of lost souls?</li>
<li>For the church with only seven saved members is better than a church with a thousand confused members.</li>
<li>As it is written, many shall be called, but few shall be chosen.</li>
<li>And: the door is narrow.</li>
<li>Galatians 1: 9-10: "Now as I told you again, now I say unto you again, If any man shall preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have received, let him be accursed: for I persuade men now or to God? Or do I seek to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. "</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>Today is taught to crucify, not to carry the cross.</li>
<li>Now, to have glory in heaven, must we have glory on earth?</li>
<li>Is God unjust because the wicked are glorified on earth while the good suffer?</li>
<li>Do Christians have to live as kings on earth?</li>
<li>Has Christ ever returned, and here is paradise?</li>
<li>Is here on earth heaven for the wicked and hell for the good?</li>
<li>But the earth is not everything, and it is not here that it will be revealed to us what we are to be.</li>
<li>For Earth, hell and heavens are similar, but different.</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 15:19: "If we hope in Christ alone in this life, we are the most miserable of all men."</li>
<li>For the one who, knowing Christ, sins; than he who sins in his ignorance.</li>
<li>By those who say they love Christ, but their hearts are on the earth,</li>
<li>And they give priority to things that are vanity (vanity are things that are not eternal), they are like the most sinful of all.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>
<ol>
<li>Who sins more? The wanderer who can become a new creature, or what he says is a new creature and does not recognize his mistakes?</li>
<li>For whoever claims to be already converted, and sinning voluntarily,</li>
<li>He does not allow himself to become Spirit and truth, not word.</li>
<li>Can he who says he has become converted convert himself without believing to have deviated from the path?</li>
<li>For they live as deviants but claiming to be converted.</li>
<li>And yet they want to repress whom they call sinners!</li>
<li>What will we do about people like that? Teach them, admonishing with humility that comes from love,</li>
<li>And fight in prayers for those whom we believe may come to repentance.</li>
<li>As for us, let us not think that God and the Bible are equal to these hypocrites, their doctrines, and their churches.</li>
<li>Let us love above all things, loving God above all things,</li>
<li>Loving the neighbor more than we love, and loving us above the corruptions that this world offers;</li>
<li>Gluttonies, drunking, smoking, sensuality, malice, envy and things similar to these.</li>
<li>For these are evil to the body (the temple of the Holy Spirit) and to the soul.</li>
<li>I am neither a priest nor a pastor. I do not consider myself a worker, because of so many failures.</li>
<li>I have no church, I have no religion.</li>
<li>But I ask that you receive this letter as receiving it from an apostle, knowing that I am not.</li>
<li>May our greatest love be to Christ Jesus, so also shall we love the Father; for God is one.</li>
<li>And if we love Jesus, we suffer with him, and with him we shall rise in glory.</li>
<li>Galatians 1: 7: "Who is no other, but there are some who trouble you and want to disrupt the gospel of Christ."</li>
<li>Today, many churches are uneasy and scandalized;</li>
<li>Being hypocrites on one side, disbelieving on the other.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>
<ol>
<li>But he who is of God knows that in himself he receives the presence of Jesus and the Spirit,</li>
<li>Who loves his neighbor and helps all, who seek to gather with other sincere Christians and admonish the wicked,</li>
<li>Who seeks knowledge of the truth and is not embarrassed by the affairs of this life.</li>
<li>Colossians 3:23: "Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as to the Lord, and not to men."</li>
<li>John 12: 42-43: "Yet many of the rulers believed in him;</li>
<li>But they did not confess him because of the Pharisees, lest they be expelled from the synagogue.</li>
<li>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. "</li>
<li>Matthew 24:35: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."</li>
<li>Matthew 24: 38-39: "For as in the days before the flood they did eat, drink, marry, and marry, until the day that Noah entered into the ark.</li>
<li>And they did not perceive it, until the flood came, and brought them all, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. "</li>
<li>And why do those who say they are converted but sinners sin?</li>
<li>John 9: 39-41: "And Jesus said unto him,</li>
<li>I have come into this world for judgment, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may be blind. "</li>
<li>And the Pharisees that were with him heard it, and said unto him,</li>
<li>Are we also blind? Jesus said to them,</li>
<li>If ye were blind, ye would have no sin; but as you now say, we see; therefore your sin remains. "</li>
<li>Galatians 5:14: "Let the whole law be fulfilled in one word, in this: thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</li>
<li>Romans 6:12: "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in its lusts."</li>
<li>2 Corinthians 2:17: "For we are not as many as counterfeiters of the word of God, but we speak of Christ sincerely, as of God in the presence of God."</li>
<li>Read also Galatians 5: 17-25, and Philippians 4.</li>
<li>As a man, I got very tired writing this letter, but my spirit rejoices.</li>
<li>Read with love and diligence all the biblical quotations contained herein.</li>
<li>Grace and peace, and love, be with you.</li>
