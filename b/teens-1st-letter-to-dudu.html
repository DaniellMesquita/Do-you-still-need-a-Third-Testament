<center><h1>1st letter to Dudu</h1></center>

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<ol>
<li>I address this letter to a person I admire.</li>
<li>I write during a fury I have never had and that I have never controlled so much; even while not sleeping.</li>
<li>Since we were born, we have a best friend and a worst enemy: ourselves.</li>
<li>With our good feelings, "desires", "pleasures", good intentions, loves, intelligence, dreams, joys, courage; We are our best friend.</li>
<li>With our bad feelings, dislikes, disappointments, bad intentions, furies, foolishness, sadness, fear; we are our worst enemy.</li>
<li>All people have let me down, including my own mother.</li>
<li>Not even our entire trust could be deposited.</li>
<li>If we trust someone, trust them with suspicion.</li>
<li>But not trusting needs to be prioritized.</li>
<li>I remember when we came here in January, and I told you about God.</li>
<li>At that time it was only a few days before I began to try to understand existence, the senses, the everything, God.</li>
<li>But after that, I went astray and became a sinner, even though I knew that I was sinning.</li>
<li>And when we sin willingly (knowing that we are sinning) it is worse than when we sin without knowing.</li>
<li>Those Indians will be resurrected and will live in the house of God;</li>
<li>It's not in the Bible, but I know it.</li>
<li>I could tell you of your sins (and I am wrong not to do this) but I fear that, like me, you will sin by ignoring.</li>
<li>It is not the time for this, and I wish you to be happy.</li>
<li>You have less sin than I; parts less than most in this house.</li>
<li>Truly you are worthy to pray at the table, and God hears you more.</li>
<li>From the first day I saw you and your sister, by bike, here in this house; I saw light in you.</li>
<li>My mother said, "You are prime cousins, Daniell is shy and would not have done it," but I dropped all my self to simply reverence them.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<ol>
<li>I have more affinity with dogs, but I am an expert on humans.</li>
<li>But I was disappointed with myself by being disappointed with people.</li>
<li>I see the potential hidden in people: I know what they can be, what they feel, etc.</li>
<li>But in some people I feel a much stronger light.</li>
<li>I look crazy writing (I even write well, even with my present state of nerves) but this letter can build you;</li>
<li>I do not write it by myself.</li>
<li>I love to see people happy, and I love to see the dreams and the grace that people see in life.</li>
<li>I love people who love, I love to see people in loving contact with nature, I love to know that there are still people who dream, I love to see the human warmth of people who have affection;</li>
<li>I love a child's smile, innocent and happy laughter;</li>
<li>I love people of brightness who see grace in good things and who with much love celebrate existence;</li>
<li>I love those who care for one another, those who love that which is weak and helpless;</li>
<li>I love sincere people;</li>
<li>I love couples who love each other;</li>
<li>I love human kindness, faith, and wisdom;</li>
<li>I love humanity as the bodies of God.</li>
<li>But I can not believe it!</li>
<li>The human being has been disappointing and unreliable.</li>
<li>Humanity does not cease to corrupt itself and cause fear, hatred and disbelief.</li>
<li>How to believe in God?</li>
<li>But I do not come to doubt.</li>
<li>I come to do for you what I do not do for myself; because I am weak.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<ol>
<li>When I told you about what made me approach God, I told confusedly, crying.</li>
<li>You were not very stable emotionally either, and you were also very emotional.</li>
<li>For a long time I have walked in agnosticism and atheism, not being able to believe that God is the same as the Bible.</li>
<li>And God had never shown Himself to me as the same of the Bible;</li>
<li>Nor did his creation prove to have a god other than a god who forsook and ignored the suffering of his people.</li>
<li>There are thousands of religions, and many that came before the Bible.</li>
<li>Others still show the Bible as a feather of plagiarism.</li>
<li>How to believe in the God of the Bible?</li>
<li>Why did I write this letter to you?</li>
<li>For you to laugh at me or despise?</li>
<li>Am I not wasting my time?</li>
<li>Am I not writing against myself?</li>
<li>I have never written with so much discouragement.</li>
<li>And I've never felt such hatred, or anger.</li>
<li>But I have balanced myself.</li>
<li>Imagine being me, walking with the mother I have and seeing everything I see.</li>
<li>And being held responsible for everything that has happened.</li>
<li>But I can not do foolish things, nor do I want to.</li>
<li>I do not write to speak of myself (and I ask you not to worry about me) but to build you.</li>
<li>You know more than I do about what's going on.</li>
<li>But you do not know more about who is above all this, and the meaning of it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<ol>
<li>Suffering and anger blind, so I will tell you about the things in which even I am having doubts.</li>
<li>Because I do not want you to be blind.</li>
<li>And God will use you a lot in the future.</li>
<li>Is God hard and Jesus good?</li>
<li>Are God and Jesus completely different?</li>
<li>Between heaven and earth are there more things than vain philosophies?</li>
<li>Why does the Bible contradict itself?</li>
<li>Jesus said, "I and the Father are one."</li>
<li>Then why does God say one thing but then Jesus says another?</li>
<li>Jesus and Satan compete; could not God just not have created it?</li>
<li>Why did God create evil?</li>
<li>Why does God create the wicked and then speak in hell?</li>
<li>Why a will and then a new one contradicting?</li>
<li>Like the devil, did Jesus contradict the words of God?</li>
<li>Eye for eye tooth for tooth (in Old Testament) and then Jesus asks to turn the other cheek?</li>
<li>What is the point of this?</li>
<li>Why do not we just ignore it all and follow our desires?</li>
<li>The report about the brothers who died embracing, how God allowed this against children?</li>
<li>I do not even know what to write.</li>
<li>Sadness and confusion overwhelmed me.</li>
<li><b>Where is this God who they speaks so much?</b></li>
<li><b>What is the meaning of life?</b></li>
<li><b>What is this God?</b></li>
<li><b>What to prefer?</b></li>
<li>What about our bodies? And our soul? And our spirit?</li>
<li>Life on Earth or the afterlife?</li>
<li>What to believe in?</li>
<li>Will we not repent of having invested in the Earth instead of in the things of God?</li>
<li>Or is the opposite useless because we have no soul and no god in the heavens?</li>
<li><b>We men are tormented and confused with so many doubts!</b></li>
<li><b>Why do not we just think "f\*\*k"?</b><li>
<li><b>I want to shout: "F\*\*K!!!!"</b>.</li>
<li>I could not feed myself today.</li>
<li>You may not have heard everything I've heard.</li>
<li>But you are different from him (Lelo), and better than him.</li>
<li>Do not mind not accompanying you in the church;</li>
<li>You are different and God takes pleasure in you for it.</li>
<li>Today I held myself, as I held on that day when 3 women were beaten at the same time.</li>
<li>And you think it was just two, but I do not write this to quarrels.</li>
<li>I do not see you in the same way.</li>
<li>You are calm, quiet, virtuous, and good.</li>
<li>You save your soul, and work to save others, and not to be shaken by those you can not save.</li>
<li>When you complete your studies, being an elder will help you in this.</li>
<li>Do not worry, God provides for you.</li>
<li>Who gave you such a good job? Above all, the one who helps is God.</li>
<li>And I was happy to pray for you (as I promised) and God to answer.</li>
<li>That same day that I told you that God speaks in thunder, there was a storm, did you notice? That's a sign.</li>
</ol>


<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<ol>
<li>Does God ignore people's suffering?</li>
<li>Our life on earth is like a tale, and a test.</li>
<li>We experience experiences to form and maintain what we will be in the second life.</li>
<li>How to have the product ready without first having the beta stage?</li>
<li>The new, the second.</li>
<li>How to have a new living testament, and love, without first having an old testament of death and hatred?</li>
<li>How to admire evolution and a beautiful history, without first knowing the past of struggles?</li>
<li>Old creature, new creature.</li>
<li>First testament, second testament.</li>
<li>First life, second life.</li>
<li>Invisible God, Jesus man.</li>
<li>God is in us.</li>
<li>He feels what we feel, like a second spirit.</li>
<li>This is very difficult to understand!</li>
<li>Why does not God want "sensuality"?</li>
<li>Because is on both sides between two people.</li>
<li>God is among and within more than seven (7) billion people at a time; omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent.</li>
<li>Omniscient: She knows and feels the pains and joys of everything and everything (God is in All and is "All");</li>
<li>Omnipresent: She is in everyone, and in everything, because she is the All.</li>
<li>Omnipotent: your power, thoughts, feelings, and deeds are in everything and achieve everything.</li>
<li>I spoke in "sensualities", but a couple that does not betray each other, is the same flesh, and are allowed to become sensuous.</li>
<li>For man hath no power over his body, but his wife hath.</li>
<li>While the woman has no power over her body, but her man has it. So it is mutual.</li>
<li>There is the first, and the second.</li>
<li>The set, and the complement.</li>
<li>The head, and the body.</li>
<li>God is invisible, so she made the project humanity, to be her body and image.</li>
<li>And these images of God have their own self, that God may be more glory.</li>
<li>God is many selves in the same self.</li>
<li>God needed to speak to mankind, and for humans to strive, she created the Bible instead of simply speaking in the clouds;</li>
<li>It is fitting that the Bible be put to the test and confusions between religions and philosophies to merit people.</li>
<li>But God also speaks in other ways, but not directly, as a challenge.</li>
<li>As the new is better than the old (in the things of God) so evil was created for good;</li>
<li>Not in the moment, but when the good excels over the bad.</li>
<li>And as it is written, they shall say: Death is swallowed up in victory.</li>
<li>If you still have doubts, you can ask me, or read the other letters, to discern.</li>
<li>Read this letter with her, before you think of a church;</li>
<li>Be strong in wisdom and faith!</li>
<li>Or if you have a punch for me and return the letter, thank God for handing you a key from heaven.</li>
<li>This prophet loves you, and Jesus even more.</li>

<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<ol>
<li>I will abandon "Christianity" and follow another religion if:</li>
<li>Also speak that God is eternal and infinite;</li>
<li>Also speak that God is invisible but real;</li>
<li>Also speak that all cogitations of man is that there is no God;</li>
<li>Also speak that love is the bond of perfection;</li>
<li>To also say that in fear there is not the perfection of love;</li>
<li>Also speak that man is the image and likeness of God;</li>
<li>Also speak that God is love;</li>
<li>Also speak that God has a first fruits of all his creatures (Jesus);
<li>Also speak that God is perfect;</li>
<li>Also speak that wisdom is the main thing;</li>
<li>Also speak that God has made the wisdom of men foolish;</li>
<li>Also speak that the thoughts of God can not be counted before him;</li>
<li>Also speak that the mercy of God is greater than the truth;</li>
<li>Also speak that mercy shall triumph of judgment;</li>
<li>Also speak that the brethren of the poor shall be their enemies;</li>
<li>Also speak that many will be called and few chosen;</li>
<li>Also speak that at the end of the world there will be famine, plagues and earthquakes;</li>
<li>Also speak that there is a third heaven;</li>
<li>Also speak that there will be signs in the heavens;</li>
<li>Also speak that all sounds have a meaning;</li>
<li>Also speak that thunders are the voice of God;</li>
<li>Also speak that there is no one righteous, not even one;</li>
<li>Also speak that "all" is vanity;</li>
<li>Also speak that God is not a god of confusion;</li>
<li>Also speak that evil men are vessels of wrath, and with much patience God supports;</li>
<li>Also speak that our life is like a tale;</li>
<li>Also say that not all will pay here on Earth;</li>
<li>Also speak that the good pay before the bad;</li>
<li>Also speak that those who live a lot can not be proud;</li>
<li>Also speak that the devil is the god of that age;</li>
<li>Also speak that gossips bring gifts and flatter;</li>
<li>Also speak that hell is never satisfied;</li>
<li>Also speak that God is the father of orphans and the widow's Judge;</li>
<li>Also speak that money is the root of "all" a kind of evil;</li>
<li>Also say that we can not serve two masters;</li>
<li>Also speak that all would know the Lord.</li>
<li>The religion that has all this, and other important things it has in the Bible, is perfect.</li>
<li>And for this reason Christianity is the greatest religion on earth; and we had him as his first love, and we grew up with him.</li>
