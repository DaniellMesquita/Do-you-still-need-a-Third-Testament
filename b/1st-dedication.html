<center><h1>1st Dedication</h1></center>

<p>With <b>love</b>, dedicated to <b>agnostics</b>, <b>atheists</b>, <b>prostitutes</b>, <b>libertarians</b>, <b>LGBTs</b>, <b>feminists</b>, and other <b>religious</b> and <b>activists</b>.</p>

<p>Read, even if it's to laugh.</p>

<p>I am a prophet who came to unite the Orientals and the Westerners; the scientists and those of faith; the agnostics and the religious; fools and wise men.</p>

<p>To the <b>Agnostics, Pagans and Atheists</b>:</p>

<p>I explain the origin of the Universe in the 1st and 2nd letter to the Chinese contained in this book, in an understandable and "scientific" way.</p>

<p>To <b>Christians and Religious</b>:</p>

<p>If we say that existence comes from God, we are labeling it as non-existent.</p>

<p>If we say that God is in existence, we are limiting it.</p>

<p>Therefore, God is Existence itself; and lightly we call existence: God.</p>



<p>This book contains dialogues, songs and letters, and the readings I recommend for each class:</p>

<p>To the <b>Agnostics, Pagans and Atheists</b>, I recommend:</p>

<p>All letters to the Chinese.</p>

<p>To the <b>Unbelievers and Teens</b>, I recommend:</p>

<p>1st Letter to Dudu, 4th Letter to Blumenauenses, 4th Letter to Matinhos.</p>

<p>To <b>Christians and Religious</b>, I recommend:</p>

<p>All letters from the letters to the Chinese.</p>

<p>I do not recommend to Christians and some Religious (unless they are strong and emotionally stable people when reading) the reading of all letters to the Chinese, because they have a very strong tone of reading. And they will bump into each other and say "this man is an atheist" before they read and understand everything.</p>

<p>For those who are a firm Christian, I recommend reading in the Adult section.</p>

<p>To <b>Activists and Humorists</b>, I recommend:</p>

<p>4th Letter to the Blumenauans, where I tell about my past of protests and militants and I talk about humor and love.</p>
