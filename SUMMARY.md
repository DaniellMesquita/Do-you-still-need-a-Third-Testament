<h1>Do you still need a third testment?</h1>

<h2>1st Dedication</h2>

With <b>love</b>, dedicated to <b>agnostics</b>, <b>atheists</b>, <b>prostitutes</b>, <b>libertarians</b>, <b>LGBTs</b>, <b>feminists</b>, and other <b>religious</b> and <b>activists</b>.

Read, even if it's to laugh.

I am a prophet who came to unite the Orientals and the Westerners; the scientists and those of faith; the agnostics and the religious; fools and wise men.

To the <b>Agnostics, Pagans and Atheists</b>:

I explain the origin of the Universe in the 1st and 2nd letter to the Chinese contained in this book, in an understandable and "scientific" way.

To <b>Christians and Religious</b>:

If we say that existence comes from God, we are labeling it as non-existent.

If we say that God is in existence, we are limiting it.

Therefore, God is Existence itself; and lightly call existence: God.



This book contains dialogues, songs and letters, and the readings I recommend for each class:

To the <b>Agnostics, Pagans and Atheists</b>, I recommend:

All letters to the Chinese.

To the <b>Unbelievers and Teens</b>, I recommend:

1st Letter to Dudu, 4th Letter to Blumenauenses, 4th Letter to Matinhos.

To <b>Christians and Religious</b>, I recommend:

All letters from the letters to the Chinese.

I do not recommend to Christians and some Religious (unless they are strong and emotionally stable people when reading) the reading of all letters to the Chinese, because they have a very strong tone of reading. And they will bump into each other and say "this man is an atheist" before they read and understand everything.

For those who are a firm Christian, I recommend reading in the Adult section.

To <b>Activists and Humorists</b>, I recommend:

4th Letter to the Blumenauans, where I tell about my past of protests and militants and I talk about humor and love.
