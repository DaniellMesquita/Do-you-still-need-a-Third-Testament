# 1st Dedication

With **love**, dedicated to **agnostics**, **atheists**, **prostitutes**, **libertarians**, **LGBTs**, **feminists**, and other **religious** and **activists**.

Read, even if it's to laugh.

I am a prophet who came to unite the Orientals and the Westerners; the scientists and those of faith; the agnostics and the religious; fools and wise men.

To the **Agnostics, Pagans and Atheists**:

I explain the origin of the Universe in the 1st and 2nd letter to the Chinese contained in this book, in an understandable and "scientific" way.

To **Christians and Religious**:

If we say that existence comes from God, we are labeling it as non-existent.

If we say that God is in existence, we are limiting it.

Therefore, God is Existence itself; and lightly call existence: God.



This book contains dialogues, songs and letters, and the readings I recommend for each class:

To the **Agnostics, Pagans and Atheists**, I recommend:

All letters to the Chinese.

To the **Unbelievers and Teens**, I recommend:

1st Letter to Dudu, 4th Letter to Blumenauenses, 4th Letter to Matinhos.

To **Christians and Religious**, I recommend:

All letters from the letters to the Chinese.

I do not recommend to Christians and some Religious \(unless they are strong and emotionally stable people when reading\) the reading of all letters to the Chinese, because they have a very strong tone of reading. And they will bump into each other and say "this man is an atheist" before they read and understand everything.

For those who are a firm Christian, I recommend reading in the Adult section.

To **Activists and Humorists**, I recommend:

4th Letter to the Blumenauans, where I tell about my past of protests and militants and I talk about humor and love.
